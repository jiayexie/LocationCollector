LocationCollector
=================

LocationCollector is an Android application for collecting location data of user-defined buildings. The user can add, edit, and delete buildings, and for each building, use network or GPS to update the location of the building. Location of a building is coarsely recorded by the north bound, south bound, west bound and east bound.
